# GA-instructor-project

This application allows a user to search for movie titles, look at results, and store 'favorite' movies in a static JSON file format.

Things I wish I had time to do:
- Add a 'back to results' and 'back to favorites' button when inspecting a specific movie and remove the search bar when looking at search results.
- Add a 'this is already a favorite' message when adding a movie as a favorite, if it already exists in the favorites JSON.
- Use MongoDB instead of the static JSON file.

This is an old domain I had that wasn't being used, so excuse the odd domain name.
